The `reviewed:` line is required. Code built by Claude Code is reviewed by Codex,
never by the model that wrote it. If a task genuinely needed no independent review,
write `reviewed: n/a (<why>)` so the decision is visible rather than missing.

adversary: DEFECT fixed in 0d67171, attacks run: 9, test: tests/t00-mint-symbol-verification.ts
notes: SPYx and NVDAx addresses are not in the pack. Sourced from Backed's own
product pages (assets.backed.fi, `data-network-address`), then verified on-chain
before entering the allowlist: Token-2022 owner, ScaledUiAmountConfig present,
the symbol read from the mint's own TokenMetadata, and the mint pubkey inside
that metadata bound to the address the bytes came from. All four decimals=8, all
four share the scaled-UI authority S7vYFFWH6BjJyEsdrPQpqpYTqLTrPRK6KW3VwsJuRaS.

The adversary DEFECT: the symbol check was skipped entirely when metadata was
absent or unreadable, so an unidentified mint became a "verified" fixture, and a
swallowed throw let a hostile issuer switch the check off. Test proven to fail
against the vulnerable guard and pass against the fix.

Adversary's unproven suspicion turned out to be a real gap and is closed: only
NFLXx was asserted, so a drifted AAPLx fixture would have passed T00 and only
surfaced at T02/T03. The values SPEC 9b.1 records are now asserted for both, and
drift stops the run rather than being absorbed, since it would mean the SPEC
section 10 G1 vectors are stale. That is a design decision, not a build one.

Caught during verification: an edit of mine had deleted the writeFileSync call,
so the fetcher verified everything and wrote nothing, which made the adversary
test pass vacuously. Restored, and every result above re-run against code that
writes.

reviewed: Codex VERDICT: REVISE on 3270b45, all 6 findings fixed, awaiting re-review
adversary: covered by round 0; its test was rewritten to 10 cases per Codex finding 5
notes: Codex findings and fixes, in its order.
1 MAJOR, genesis: SOLANA_RPC_URL accepted any endpoint. assertMainnet() now calls
  getGenesisHash and refuses anything but 5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdpKuc147dw2N9d,
  read from api.mainnet-beta.solana.com 2026-09-21.
2 MAJOR, provenance: self-reported symbol and embedded mint prove nothing, since an
  attacker controls both. Pinned three anchors that need Backed's keys, taken from the
  two mints SPEC 9b.1 verifies independently of this script: scaled-UI authority
  S7vYFFWH6BjJyEsdrPQpqpYTqLTrPRK6KW3VwsJuRaS, metadata update authority
  5aMNNLQJwAEeoemTEMkv5NVjqKwvvefRYCQ5Z67HFvEq, and a xstocks-metadata.backed.fi URI
  whose path names the symbol. Removing the URI check alone lets a genuine Backed mint
  be relabelled as another xStock and accepted, proven by mutation.
3 MINOR, TLV: now asserts account type is Mint, rejects trailing bytes, rejects a
  duplicated extension instead of taking the first, and requires ScaledUiAmountConfig
  to be exactly 56 bytes.
4 MAJOR outside: writes were incremental, so a late failure left a mixed snapshot for
  T03/T06. All fixtures are staged in a temp dir and renamed in only after every mint
  passes. Every failing case now asserts nothing was left on disk.
5 MINOR, test: rewritten from 2 cases to 10, each asserting its own specific failure
  text so a case cannot pass on an unrelated error, plus a positive control. It caught
  a real flaw in my own case design immediately: the authority case was failing on the
  embedded-mint check instead.
6 MINOR outside: P1's verify command is now `pnpm tsx tests/p1-harness-proof.ts`.

Codex's output is deliberately NOT written to reviews/*review*.md: check-reviews.sh
requires `VERDICT: implementation-ready` or `changes required` there, and fails on the
latter, so a REVISE verdict in that path would break the harness. Gate reviews go
there at T07; task-level rounds live here.
